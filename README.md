# Stack UnderTow

Stack Undertow was a project for my rails week 4 course at Epicodus. The idea for the app was to create a replicate site of stackover flow. 

## Usage

To run this project you must have rails installed.

Open project in terminal and run bundle to install necessary gems and run the following in terminal.

```
rake db:create
rake db:seed
rake db:migrate
rails s
```

You should then be able to open on localhost:3000. You can then post questions to have answered and can answer any questions that have been posted as well as comment on answers.
